# Wordpress Dev Theme

Empty Wordpress theme for development.

### Gulp Stuff

You will need to install the following plugins as dependancies to run the Gulp tasks. Navigate to the root of the theme in your terminal and run these commands.

```
npm install --global gulp
npm install gulp-sass --save-dev
npm install gulp-autoprefixer --save-dev
```

Run Gulp to process your SASS and start the watch task.

```
gulp
```

### CSS Autoprefixer

PostCSS plugin to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules using values from Can I Use.

### Normalize CSS Reset

This template uses Normalize.css. This makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.

```

   |\          .(' *) ' .
   | \        '.*) WP )*
   |(*\      .*(// .*) .
   |___\       // (. '*
   ((("'\     // '  * .
   ((c'7')   /\)
   ((((^))  /  \
 .-')))(((-'   /
    (((()) __/'
     )))( |
      (()
       ))

```
